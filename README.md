# DualShock2KeyCommand
This is Arduino Project that makes PlayStation 4 Controller turn into PC Macro Keyboard and Mouse.
As macro is hard-coded and specialized for my purpose, it was private in 2021.
But I made it public as there are nothing special to be hidden.
So, I have no support for this code or setup.

## Usage
Click specific button with pressing PS button changes controller modes.
Assign may be changed in the future without maintain this page. Sorry but you can check by source code.

### Touhou Mode
Press Circle with PS button to turn in Touhou Mode.
Touhou is series of 2D vertical scroll shooting game.

### Outlook Mode
Press Triangle with PS button to turn in Outlook Mode.
It's for my work. Reading e-mail efficiently with PS4 Controller.

### Mouse Mode
Press R1 with PS button to turn in Mouse Mode.
I use this mode with relaxing on rocking chair.
Mainly for non-keyboard task such as watching YouTube video.
This mode might be useful for everyone.

### Default Mode
Pless Cross with PS button to turn in Default Mode.
This mode does nothing special. Just use to avoid misoperation by unintentional button touch.

## Setup
It requires HID compatible Arduino and USB Host Sheild.
How to connect is written in links down below.
Sorry both page in the link are written in Japanese.
You can use Google Translate or find other good page written in English with keyword "Arduino USB Host Shield".
